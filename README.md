## Afa travel
This is a learning web project built to practice working with APIs, `localStorage`, and multilingual support using JSON files and `data-i18n` attributes. This responsive application helps users plan their travels by selecting a country and city to view weather, gallery images, and key facts about the destination.

> The layout is built with a mobile-first approach, as the majority of website visitors use mobile devices. The project is fully responsive and adapts to both desktop and tablet screens.

## Key Features

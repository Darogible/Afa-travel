## Afa travel
This is a learning web project built to practice working with APIs, `localStorage`, and multilingual support using JSON files and `data-i18n` attributes. This responsive application helps users plan their travels by selecting a country and city to view weather, gallery images, and key facts about the destination.

- LocalStorage for saving user-selected languages and favorite cities
- Live weather forecast using [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/)
- Country information (flag, population, area, currency, languages) using [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/)

- Option to save and manage favorite destinations

## Technologies Used
